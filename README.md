## Projects
- <b>[SUGEP](https://sugep.ifg.edu.br/eventos/#/)</b> - SUGEP is unified management system of research and event, developed and maintained since 2013 for the Federal Institute of Education, Science, and Technology of the State of Goiás (IFG). The system is responsible for managing events and managing scientific initiation projects, controlling the entire flow of activities such as: registration, issuance of certificates, logistics management, messaging, etc. The system is registered with the Brazilian National Institute of Intellectual Property (INPI) with registration number BR512015000429-8. __Technologies Involved:__ *Java EE, [Spring](https://spring.io), [Hibernate](https://hibernate.org/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/), [Bower](https://bower.io/), [Apache Maven Project](https://maven.apache.org/what-is-maven.html), [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/), [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/), [Less CSS](https://lesscss.org/), [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/)*
- <b>[SUSE](http://suse.ifg.edu.br/suse/#/)</b> - SUSE is a unified selection system designed to manage the graduate selection process in Federal Institute of Education, Science, and Technology of the State of Goiás (IFG). The system controls the subscription flow of interested in participating in the selection process, collecting documents, issuing guides for payment of tax, and automating activities in order to assist in the final classification process of candidates. __Technologies Involved:__ *Java EE, [Spring](https://spring.io), [Hibernate](https://hibernate.org/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/), [Bower](https://bower.io/), [Apache Maven Project](https://maven.apache.org/what-is-maven.html), [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/), [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/), [Less CSS](https://lesscss.org/), [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/)*
- [SOFTWAY4IoT](https://github.com/sw4iot) - SOFTware-defined gateWAY and fog computing for IoT aims to address four basic problems: 1) Need to support multiple wireless communication technologies for IoT, eg, *Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, nRF24, Z-Wave*; 2) Need for minimize the impact of choosing an unconsolidated wireless communication technology for IoT; 3) Exposure public of IoT devices on the internet, i.e. potential risks related to the network security of the devices; 4)Device connectivity with the infrastructure for data collection and processing, typically acloud computing infrastructure. The project generated a set of software artifacts duly registered with the Brazilian National Institute of Intellectual Property (INPI): _ORQCGIoT BR512020002007-0, ICSGWIoT BR512020002006-2_ and _GEREIoT BR512020002004-6_. __Technologies Involved:__ *[Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Open vSwitch](https://www.openvswitch.org/), [Angular](https://angular.io/)*

## Online Technical Contents (Tutorials / Short Training)
- [A Softwarized Perspective of 5G Networks - IEEE NetSoft 2020 Conference](https://ieeetv.ieee.org/tutorial-4-a-softwarized-perspective-of-5g-networks-netsoft-2020-conference) - The main goal of this tutorial is to explore the softwarization in the 5G system composed of the radio access network (RAN) and the core components, following the standards defined by 3GPP, particularly the Release 15. The tutorial will provide a brief overview of wireless mobile cellular networks, including basic concepts and the evolution through the called ‘generations’ of mobile networks. 
- [NWDAF with Free5GC - Development Environment Presentation](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE1dbu0BEXvEL23gptSgux8gPmuLmyQOm) - **(Only Portuguese)** In this playlist I present a series of videos demonstrating how to configure the _development environment of the free5GC_ project, integrating with an NWDAF project developed by me. The project is under development and aims to collect data from the information produced by the components of the 5G system.
